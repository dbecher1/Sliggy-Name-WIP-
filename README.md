# Sliggy?
(name wip)

Intending for this to be a SDL based skinnable immediate mode GUI to use for games as a frontend UI. I don't like using pretty much any UI library, as they feel relatively unintuitive or cumbersome to me to use. My main design goal with this library is to make it as easy and painless as possible to make good, relatively customizable user-facing GUIs.

It's still rife with bugs and has not even a quarter of what I want it to have implemented. Eventual goal include:

- Automatic formatting of text (such as centered, right, etc)
- RPG style dialog where text is progressively rendered
- Menu style UIs with selections and indicators
- The ability to bind functions to menu choices
- An arbitrary amount of texture skins/fonts and the ability to swap between them
- Loading UI blueprints from data

But... that name kinda stinks.

I'm very bad at naming things. I wanted to come up with an acronym along the lines of like... SDL Light Immediate-Mode GUI, but SLIG or SLIMGui either sounded weird or too much like something else. I was going to name it Slippy, but then I changed it to Sliggy, and I still don't like it.

Again, this is very much so WIP, this is currently my main project outside of school.
